###Notes:
* Change the debugging configuration in the utils script to enable 
DEBUG level logging
* Logging will appear in "SevenPark.log" based on the debugging parameter

* Final Results for all data will be sent to "SevenParkChallenge.xlsx" as an Excel workbook

* The 'use_cache' parameter in ChallengeTwo can be used for testing to hold 
the API data locally as a csv file, and be reloaded as required

* Due to unicode errors, code must run in Python 3
